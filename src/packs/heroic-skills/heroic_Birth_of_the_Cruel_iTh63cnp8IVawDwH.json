If you do, their corpse becomes a <strong>Minion</strong> who obeys your telepathic commands:</p><ul><li>Its Species becomes <strong>undead</strong> and it receives all <strong>Undead rules</strong> (see <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, page <strong>305</strong>). The new Affinities to <strong>dark</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, and <strong>poison</strong> damage overwrite any preexisting Affinity, but the original Species' rules are otherwise <strong>maintained</strong>.</li><li>Its <strong>Rank</strong> becomes <strong>soldier</strong>; if the original creature was an <strong>Ã©lite</strong> or <strong>champion</strong>, the GM must reduce the Minion's HP and MP accordingly (Skills are <strong>maintained</strong>).</li><li>The newly created Minion is a completely new creature and has full HP, full MP, and no status effects. It retains the original creature's <strong>equipment</strong>.</li><li>Your Minion takes its own turn during conflicts, and the Game Master must count it as an <strong>additional Player Character</strong> when designing a conflict.</li><li>When you <strong>rest</strong>, your Minion also gains the full benefits of resting.</li><li>If your Minion is reduced to 0 Hit Points, if you are <strong>more than 1 travel day</strong> away from it, or if you die or fall unconscious, your Minion is immediately <strong>destroyed</strong>.</li><li>You may also destroy your Minion <strong>at any time</strong>; if you want to create a new Minion, you must first destroy the current one.</li><li>If your Minion is destroyed, your maximum HP and MP scores <strong>return to normal</strong>.</li></ul>",
