    "description": "<blockquote><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> you must have mastered the <strong>Arcanist </strong>Class, and your character must be <strong>level 30 or higher</strong> .</p></blockquote><p>When you summon an Arcanum, you may decide to spend 1 Fabula Point and spend half of your current Hit Points (rounded down) to shape your lifeforce into a full manifestation of their power. If you do, the Arcanum manifests as a <strong>soldier</strong> -rank creature of the <strong>demon </strong>Species under your control (they count as an ally and have their own independent turn during conflicts – if you use this Skill during a conflict scene, the Arcanum joins the scene <strong>at the end</strong> of the current round). You also do not gain any of the <strong>merge </strong>benefits you would normally enjoy when summoning that Arcanum. The summoned creature has the following profile:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Level </strong>is equal to your level (thus gaining the bonuses to Checks and damage listed under <strong>steps 8 </strong>on page <strong>303 </strong>of the <strong>Core Rulebook</strong> ).</p></li><li><p>A <strong>d10 </strong>in one Attribute of your choice, and a <strong>d8 </strong>in all other Attributes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maximum Hit Points</strong> equal to <strong>【</strong> <strong>twice the creature's base Might die size, plus half of your maximum Hit Points</strong> <strong>】</strong> . The creature has <strong>no Mind Points</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Resistance to <strong>two </strong>damage types of your choice.</p></li><li><p>The creature receives all the <strong>merge </strong>benefits the Arcanum would normally grant you when summoned (damage Affinities, immunity to status effects, increased Attribute sizes, etc.). If a <strong>merge </strong>benefit would cause the Arcanum to be dismissed, this will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>melee basic attack</strong> whose Accuracy Check relies on <strong>two different Attributes </strong>of your choice and deals <strong>【</strong> <strong>HR + 8</strong> <strong>】 physical damage</strong>. Choose <strong>two different options</strong> : the attack is a <strong>ranged </strong>attack; <strong>or </strong>it deals 4 extra damage; <strong>or </strong>it deals damage of a type other than <strong>physical</strong> ; <strong>or </strong>the Accuracy Check relies on a <strong>single Attribute</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The creature may perform the <strong>Skill </strong>action to produce one of the <strong>dismiss </strong>effects normally granted by that Arcanum, but doing so will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.</p></li></ul><p>The following rules apply when you <strong>Grand Summon</strong> an Arcanum:</p><ul><li><p>The creature is always summoned at full Hit Points, with no status effects.</p></li><li><p>The creature vanishes if it reaches 0 Hit Points, if you die, lose consciousness or leave the scene, or <strong>if you summon or Grand Summon</strong> an Arcanum again. The creature also vanishes when a scene ends, or if you simply command them to do so (this will <strong>not </strong>trigger the corresponding Arcanum's dismiss effect).</p></li><li><p>Take note of all choices made for <strong>Attributes </strong>and <strong>basic attack </strong>during the first time <strong>Summon </strong>a given Arcanum: these choices will remain unchanged whenever you <strong>Grand Summon</strong> that same Arcanum again in the future.</p></li></ul><hr /><ul><li><p><strong>You Spend:</strong> @LOSS[1 fp] and @LOSS[@actor.resources.hp.value/2 hp]{Current HP ÷ 2 HP}</p></li></ul>",
