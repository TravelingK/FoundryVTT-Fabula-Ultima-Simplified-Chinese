    "description": "<h3>THE GARDEN</h3><p>When you plant a <strong>magiseed</strong>, it takes root in your <strong>garden</strong> until removed. Your <strong>garden </strong>is an <strong>abstract</strong> space whose appearance varies depending on your character’s look: it might be a pot on their back, a gap along their blade, or even the ground under their feet. Your <strong>garden</strong> can only contain <strong>one magiseed at a time</strong>, and any <strong>magiseeds</strong> in your <strong>garden</strong> are <strong>automatically removed</strong> at the end of each scene.</p><p></p><h3>THE GROWTH CLOCK</h3><p>When you acquire the @UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ZmzDl88kGMvrumoJ]{Chloromancy} Skill, you also receive a <strong>Growth Clock</strong> which is present <strong>only</strong> during conflict scenes and represents the cycle of life in your <strong>garden.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Your <strong>Growth Clock</strong> has <strong>4 sections</strong>, and it begins each scene <strong>empty</strong>.</p></li><li><p>At the end of your turn, if a <strong>magiseed</strong> is present in your <strong>garden, fill 1 section</strong> of your Growth Clock; <strong>then</strong>, if there is still a <strong>magiseed</strong> in your <strong>garden</strong> and that <strong>magiseed</strong> has an “at the end of your turn” effect (see below), apply that effect.</p></li><li><p>When you fill the <strong>fourth section</strong> of your Growth Clock, <strong>remove</strong> the <strong>magiseeds</strong> in your <strong>garden</strong>, then <strong>erase all sections</strong> of your Growth Clock.</p></li><li><p>Sections of your Growth Clock <strong>may not be filled nor erased</strong> in any way other than described above, through <strong>Brambleheart</strong> and <strong>Green Thumb</strong> (pages <strong>162</strong> and <strong>166</strong>), or through effects that <strong>explicitly affect Growth Clocks</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>MAGISEED EFFECTS</h3><p><strong>Magiseeds</strong> can have passive effects, or have effects that trigger at the <strong>end</strong> of your turn, <strong>after</strong> your Growth Clock has increased.</p><ul><li><p>The effects of a <strong>magiseed</strong> apply only while it is present in your <strong>garden</strong>, and they vary depending on the current number of filled sections in your Growth Clock (⏱).</p></li><li><p>You only apply the effect corresponding to the <strong>exact number</strong> of currently filled sections in your <strong>Growth Clock</strong>, not any effect above or below it.</p></li><li><p>If a magiseed’s effect deals damage, it deals 5 extra damage if you are <strong>level 30 or higher</strong>. If a magiseed’s effect causes Hit Point and/or Mind Point loss and/or recovery, the amount increases by 10 if you are <strong>level 30 or higher</strong>.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>MAGISEED LIST</h3><p>Below and in the next pages you will find a list of standard <strong>magiseeds</strong> that each Floralist can discover by investing levels into the <strong>Chloromancy</strong> Skill.</p><p>Your group can also collaboratively create new <strong>magiseeds</strong>, and the Game Master may opt to include them among <strong>rewards</strong>, obtained independently of your investment in <strong>Chloromancy</strong>. Each magiseed is worth approximately 1000 zenit; try your best to keep these new <strong>magiseeds</strong> on a similar power to those on the standard list.</p><p></p><h3>Magiseed List</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.NuJwnpRP7xREY9q5]{[Handout: Magiseed List]}</p>",
