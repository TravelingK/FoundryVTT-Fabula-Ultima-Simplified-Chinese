    "description": "<h1>MANAGING THE DECK</h1><p>Your <strong>deck</strong> is an actual deck of cards that you can assemble however you prefer, provided their backs are identical and you follow the restrictions below:</p><ul><li><p>The deck contains exactly <strong>30 cards: 2 jokers</strong>, plus <strong>28</strong> cards divided into <strong>4 types</strong>, called <strong>suits</strong>; for instance, in a standard poker deck the <strong>suits</strong> are <strong>clubs</strong> ( @ICON[club]<strong> </strong>), <strong>diamonds</strong> ( @ICON[diamond] ), <strong>hearts</strong> ( @ICON[heart] ), and <strong>spades</strong> ( @ICON[spade] ). When you create your character's deck, associate each <strong>suit</strong> to a different damage type among <strong>air</strong>, <strong>earth</strong>, <strong>fire</strong>, and <strong>ice</strong>.</p></li><li><p>For each <strong>suit</strong>, the deck contains <strong>7 cards</strong> with <strong>values 1 to 7</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>The simplest approach is to use a poker deck (removing <strong>face cards</strong> and <strong>cards numbered 8 to 10</strong>), but you can also use minor arcana from tarot, cards from collectible card games, and much more; just make sure the combinations are easy to identify.</p><ul><li>When a <strong>conflict</strong> begins, shuffle all 30 cards in your <strong>deck</strong> and place it <strong>face down</strong> in front of yourself, then draw <strong>5 cards</strong> to form your starting <strong>hand</strong>.</li><li>If you need to draw cards and your <strong>deck</strong> doesn't have enough, draw as many as you can, <strong>shuffle your discard pile into the deck</strong>, place it <strong>face down</strong>, then keep drawing.</li><li>When you draw cards from your <strong>deck</strong>, they are put into your <strong>hand</strong>. Normally only you can see your <strong>hand</strong>, but you can show it to others if you so wish.</li><li>When you discard cards from your <strong>hand</strong>, place them <strong>face up</strong> into your <strong>discard pile</strong>, in whatever order you prefer. However, the order of cards in your <strong>discard pile</strong> cannot be modified.</li></ul><p>Your <strong>deck</strong>, your <strong>hand</strong>, and your <strong>discard pile</strong> (as well as any Skills and effects related to them) are only available during conflict scenes; at the end of each conflict, shuffle all 30 cards back into your <strong>deck</strong> and put it aside.</p><h3>RESOLVING A SET</h3><p>To produce a given effect, a <strong>set</strong> must match its requirements <strong>exactly</strong> (for instance, resolving a <strong>set of 5 cards with the same value</strong> will not match the requirements of <strong>Jackpot</strong>; it has to be composed of <strong>exactly 4 cards</strong>).</p><ul><li>When you resolve a <strong>set</strong> that includes <strong>jokers</strong>, you choose their <strong>suit</strong> and <strong>value</strong> (<strong>1</strong> to <strong>7</strong>).</li></ul><p>If a <strong>set</strong> matches the requirements of two or more effects, you must choose and apply <strong>only one</strong> of those effects.</p><h3><strong>Effects</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.FVmAbnxp6kZyoqkN]{[Handout: Deck]}</p>",
