    "description": "<h3>DAMAGE AND REPAIRS</h3><p>A Pilot’s <strong>personal vehicle</strong> doesn’t have its own separate stats and is treated as an extension of the Pilot themselves. It can be damaged or rendered temporarily unusable as a narrative consequence of the Pilot’s <strong>Surrender</strong>, but cannot be destroyed unless the Player agrees to it.</p><p>Repairing a narratively damaged <strong>personal vehicle</strong> requires an amount of zenit equal to <strong>【its Pilot’s SL in Personal Vehicle, multiplied by 100】</strong>. On the other hand, rebuilding a destroyed <strong>personal vehicle</strong> should be achieved as part of the Pilot’s narrative arc (which is why it should only be destroyed if the Player is okay with it).</p><p></p><h3>RARE MODULES AS REWARDS</h3><p>The Game Master should include new modules (or upgraded versions of existing modules) for the Pilot among the campaign’s rewards.</p><ul><li><p>Each <strong>weapon and armor module</strong> presented in the following pages has a base cost of 500 zenit, and their rare versions can be created using the rules for <strong>rare items</strong> found in the <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, starting on page <strong>266.</strong> There are, however, two exceptions: a weapon module’s damage can only be increased by 4 points by raising its cost by 200 zenit (it can <strong>never</strong> become two-handed), and <strong>a weapon module can never become martial</strong> (not even if its damage formula becomes <strong>【HR + 10】</strong> or higher).</p></li><li><p>Each <strong>support module</strong> presented in the following pages should have a cost of roughly 1000 zenit. If you create custom support modules, compare them with the existing ones in order to establish their cost in zenit. They are <strong>rare</strong> items.</p></li><li><p>The special rules used for some weapon modules (such as the <strong>Claymore module</strong>, which prevents you from having other weapon modules enabled, or the <strong>Shield module</strong>’s entire effect) <strong>are not Qualities</strong>, and thus cannot be lost or replaced. If a given module has a Quality, that Quality is listed <strong>before</strong> any of its special rules.</p></li><li><p>A Pilot might acquire rare modules by purchasing them from dedicated shops, by exploring factories or laboratories, or as a reward after defeating robotic or artificial adversaries. You can find some sample rare weapon modules on page <strong>86</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>And finally, as a general rule, a Pilot should <strong>never</strong> have access to two or more support modules with different names whose effects are similar and/or cumulative.</p><p></p><h3>INTERACTIONS WITH THE TINKERER CLASS</h3><p>A character with the Tinkerer Class might wish to use the @UUID[Compendium.projectfu.heroic-skills.Item.xbTcxx4ysOWOamZP]{Upgrade} Heroic Skill and the rules for <strong>Projects</strong> (see <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, pages <strong>241</strong> and <strong>134</strong>) to improve modules or invent new customizations for a Pilot’s <strong>personal vehicle</strong>. For instance, they might install a reactor to enable space flight, or an antenna that emits anti-magic waves.</p><p>When it comes to special modules created through Projects, the group as a whole should make sure these <strong>do not impede</strong> on other characters’ strengths and roles. It can be a good idea to give such modules a limited number of uses, or interesting flaws that can lead to difficult choices and memorable scenes.</p>",
