    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Archer, Gunslinger, Sniper</strong></h5><p>A majority of <strong>Sharpshooters </strong>are exceptionally good at dealing with threats from a carefully calculated distance; others are brave, skilled or reckless enough to engage their foes at point-blank. While many of these skilled snipers are battle-hardened soldiers, some have turned to a life of piracy, bounty hunting or banditry. A few have put their abilities at the service of the people, or use them to protect a sacred or forbidden site from intruders.</p><hr /><h5><strong>SHARPSHOOTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip martial ranged weapons and martial shields.</li></ul><h2><strong>SHARPSHOOTER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.lCFQMCY4AmDsv6sv]{Barrage}</p><p>When you perform a <strong>ranged </strong>attack, you may spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: the attack gains <strong>multi </strong>(2); or you increase the attack’s <strong>multi </strong>property by one, up to a maximum of <strong>multi </strong>(3).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.sIkQa2NzkqsvczBr]{Crossfire}</p><p>After a creature you can see performs a <strong>ranged </strong>attack, you may spend an amount of Mind Points equal to the total Result of their Accuracy Check in order to have the attack fail automatically against all targets.
