The words of an Orator may rekindle spirits or plunge their opponents into despair: over the centuries, some Orators’ talents have brought entire nations to ruin… and just as many have granted fallen kingdoms a chance to rise from their very ashes.</p><hr /><h5><strong>ORATOR FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.</li></ul><h2><strong>ORATOR SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.DtEiCkDsC1amYABn]{Condemn} <strong>(SL4)</strong></p><p>You may use an action and spend 5 Mind Points to perform an Opposed 【<strong>INS</strong> + <strong>WLP</strong>】 Check against a creature that can hear and understand you — describe your accusations!
