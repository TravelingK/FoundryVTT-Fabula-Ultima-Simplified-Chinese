    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Prince, Queen, Shōgun</strong></h5><p><strong>Commanders </strong>are leaders and inspiring figures. Some are of noble blood, but a majority have earned the loyalty of their comrades on the battlefield, where their iron resolve and tactical prowess were tested time and time again. When thinking about what a Commander might look like, don't feel bound to the idea of a knight in shining armor: bandit captains, fallen nobles and students of warfare are all perfect examples of what this Class may represent.</p><hr /><h5><strong>COMMANDER BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial melee weapons</strong> and <strong>martial armor</strong>.</li></ul><h2><strong>COMMANDER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.FGihIPfif7yWsBCp]{Bishop's Edict} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>During a conflict, you may use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: all MP costs are doubled; <strong>or </strong>all sources of damage deal <strong>【SL × 3】</strong>extra damage.</p><p>The chosen effect lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.VhWG5AXdBZ8hL4xr]{Charging Cavalry} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>During a conflict, you may use an action and spend 10 MP to choose one ally that can hear you. That ally may immediately perform a <strong>free attack</strong> with a weapon they have equipped (or with a <strong>basic attack</strong> if they are an NPC).
