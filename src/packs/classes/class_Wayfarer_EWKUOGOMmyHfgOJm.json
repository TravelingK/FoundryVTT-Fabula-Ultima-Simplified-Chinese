    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Adventurer, Explorer, Treasure Hunter</strong></h5><p>Nomads searching for a fabled continent, explorers braving the wilds, grizzled hunters and travelers have one thing in common: they are Wayfarers. While a majority of heroes travel the world during their adventures, <strong>Wayfarers </strong>live for the journey. They are always eager to visit new places and learn from others. In the eyes of a Wayfarer, the wilderness is neither foe nor an ally, but rather a stern teacher who can reveal many forgotten truths.</p><hr /><h5><strong>WAYFARER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.</li></ul><h2><strong>WAYFARER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.L34pOGhdH0ZwV4Bt]{Faithful Companion} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>Together with your group, create a <strong>level 5 beast, construct, elemental </strong>or<strong> plant</strong> NPC (see <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, page <strong>302</strong>), that becomes your <strong>companion</strong>: this creature has <strong>no initiative score</strong> and <strong>does not level up</strong>, can have a <strong>maximum of two basic attacks</strong>, gains a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks, and their maximum Hit Points are equal to <strong>【(SL, multiplied by the companion's base Might size) + half your level】</strong>.</p><p>Your companion doesn't get an independent turn during conflicts, but you can use an action to have them perform an action (once per turn).
