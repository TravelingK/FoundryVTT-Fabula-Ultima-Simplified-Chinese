    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Archivist, Sage, Scholar</strong></h5><p><strong>Loremasters </strong>are known for their insatiable curiosity and appetite for discovery. They firmly believe that knowledge equates to power, and would often trade all gold in the world for a chance at solving a good mystery. Unfortunately, a majority of Loremasters tend to be aloof and easily distracted, rarely concerning themselves with “pragmatic” matters… to the point of sometimes failing to realize the darker implications of their discoveries.</p><hr /><h5><strong>LOREMASTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.</li></ul><h2><strong>LOREMASTER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.J5KbrSiczxizbdM3]{Flash of Insight} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>When you roll a <strong>13 or higher</strong> on a Check performed to investigate a creature, item or location — this includes using the <strong>Study </strong>action during a conflict — you may ask the Game Master up to <strong>【SL】 </strong>questions concerning the subject of your investigation. You may ask these questions immediately or save them for later; whenever you ask one of these questions, the Game Master will answer truthfully and you will describe your character’s deductive process. This Skill may only be used once on the same creature, item or location.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.xaNu6plCZfo9dGsX]{Focused} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by <strong>【SL × 3】</strong>.</p><p>When you perform an Open Check using <strong>【INS + INS】</strong>, you gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】 </strong>on that Check (this <strong>only </strong>applies to Open Checks).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.XNAHXFdVPKiABegZ]{Knowledge Is Power}</p><p>When you perform an Accuracy Check, you may replace <strong>one </strong>of the Attribute dice with <strong>Insight </strong>(such as <strong>【INS + INS】 </strong>for a <strong>pistol </strong>or <strong>【INS + MIG】 </strong>for a <strong>waraxe</strong>).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.YiBD86tGOvFSlaZ6]{Quick Assessment} <strong>(SL6)</strong></p><p>At the start of a conflict, you may spend up to <strong>【SL × 5】 </strong>Mind Points.
