    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Healer, Priest, Witch</strong></h5><p><strong>Spiritists </strong>have developed a powerful connection with the raw aspects of soul: emotion, energy, life, and death. They wield power both miraculous and frightening, and are quite often affiliated with cults or religions. Several worlds see the powers of Spiritism as gifts from a deity or proof that a person’s heart is pure; however, there is no definite proof of these abilities coming from anything but discipline, empathy, and focus.</p><hr /><h5><strong>SPIRITIST FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.</li><li>You may perform Rituals whose effects fall within the <strong>Ritualism </strong>discipline.</li></ul><h2><strong>SPIRITIST SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.rVM7HhQ5OwdPtFwa]{Healing Power} <strong>(SL2)</strong></p><p>When you cast a spell that targets one or more allies, if you have an <strong>arcane </strong>weapon equipped, you may have each of those allies recover an amount of Hit Points equal to <strong>【SL, multiplied by the number of Bonds you have】</strong>.</p><p>This healing is separate from any healing caused by the effects of the spell.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ek0pzfo1bSWGHfzb]{Ritual Spiritism}</p><p>You may perform Rituals whose effects fall within the Spiritism discipline.</p><p>Spiritism Rituals use <strong>【INS + WLP】 </strong>for the Magic Check.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.dwVQpxDTOZeNbcjy]{Spiritual Magic} <strong>(SL10)</strong></p><p>Each time you acquire this Skill, learn one Spiritist spell (see <strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, page <strong>208</strong>).</p><p>Offensive (@ICON[offensive]) Spiritist spells use <strong>【INS + WLP】 </strong>for the Magic Check.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.pIkEDFcA5pnIpsu3]{Support Magic}</p><p>When you cast a spell that targets one or more allies, if you have an <strong>arcane </strong>weapon equipped, you may choose one of those allies you have a <strong>Bond </strong>towards.
