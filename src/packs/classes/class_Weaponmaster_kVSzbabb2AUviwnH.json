    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Fighter, Rōnin, Warrior</strong></h5><p>Weaponmasters spend years upon years honing their close combat arts. Most of them display remarkable skill with a variety of weapons; others have trained to become one with a specific armament. Many <strong>Weaponmasters </strong>follow and protect someone out of love or loyalty, but there are also those who tirelessly wander the world seeking worthy opponents, legendary magical weapons, or capable teachers.</p><hr /><h5><strong>WEAPONMASTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial melee weapons</strong> and <strong>martial shields</strong>.</li></ul><h2><strong>WEAPONMASTER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.IhBCZsilt0bj5RJK]{Bladestorm}</p><p>When you perform a <strong>melee </strong>attack, you may spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: the attack gains <strong>multi (2)</strong>; or you increase the attack’s multi property by one, up to a maximum of <strong>multi (3)</strong>.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.7jWycVYFgZ1BMxch]{Bone Crusher} <strong>(SL4)</strong></p><p>When you hit one or more targets with a <strong>melee </strong>attack that would deal damage, you may have the attack deal no damage.
