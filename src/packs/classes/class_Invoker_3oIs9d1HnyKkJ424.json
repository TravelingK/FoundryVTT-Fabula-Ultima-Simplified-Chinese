    "description": "<h5>ALSO: Channeler, Five-Soul Master, Onmyōji</h5><p><span><strong>Invokers</strong> research the innate energy of souls and the way it spontaneously flows and manifests throughout their surroundings. Even if their art relies on calling upon the power of the elements, they adapt to the existing power sources rather than force an unnatural outcome and upset the flow of spirits. That said, Invokers remain formidable adventurers: they boast great flexibility and a unique affinity for elemental creatures.</span></p><hr /><h5>INVOKER FREE BENEFITS</h5><ul><li><span>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points <strong>or</strong> Mind Points by 5 (your choice).</span></li></ul><h2>INVOKER SKILLS</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.YZkp0hXK29tfI0MI]{Elemental Harmony} <strong>(SL2)</strong></p><p><span>You may verbally communicate with creatures of the <strong>elemental</strong> Species.</span></p><p><span>When you restore a creature's Hit Points with an <strong>invocation</strong> or spell, if an <strong>elemental</strong> is present on the scene, the restored amount is increased by <strong>【SL × 5】</strong>.</span></p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.G5SMsS4TC1glE2VS]{Invocation} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p><span>You may use an action and spend 5 Mind Points to perform an <strong>invocation</strong>, drawing energy from one of the <strong>wellsprings</strong> present on the scene </span>(see <strong>Natural Fantasy Atlas</strong>, page <strong>156</strong>)<span>.
