    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Calligrapher, Painter, Runemaker</strong></h5><p>There is great power within symbols and images, and no one knows this better than a <strong>Symbolist</strong>. Rather than a magical discipline, symbolism could be described as a study of how to weave supernatural energies into signs and icons: these may be paintings, runes, talismans and more. Most Symbolists develop their skills through intense practice and meticulous study, but there are many who view this magical discipline as a way to freely express their artistic vision.</p><hr /><h5><strong>SYMBOLIST FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.</li></ul><h2><strong>SYMBOLIST SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ffgsQbg3SuWBUUS2]{Magic Symbols} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>If an ally bears one of your <strong>symbols</strong>, that ally may perform the <strong>Spell</strong> action and destroy that symbol to cast a single spell among those you know, as long as it has a total Mind Point cost equal to or lower than<strong> 【SL × 10】</strong>(that ally must still pay the MP cost).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.mqwu1cSVPhWdT2Mt]{Mirage}</p><p>You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the <strong>Ritualism</strong> discipline; additionally, you may use <strong>Ritualism</strong> to create sight-based illusions.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.nAX4AsRoQhmO6gnf]{Personal Touch} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>When a creature you can see that is bearing one of your <strong>symbols</strong> suffers damage or recovers Hit Points and/or Mind Points, you may have that creature suffer <strong>【SL】 </strong>extra damage or recover <strong>【SL】 </strong>additional Hit Points and/or Mind Points, respectively).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.h6ynrwX1sUsBQYAE]{Symbolic Connection}</p><p>You always know the exact direction in which to find any creature bearing one of your <strong>symbols</strong>, as long as that creature is within <strong>2 travel days</strong> of your position.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.Twj3wpoMzSpUE3Go]{Symbolism} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>Each time you acquire this Skill, you learn <strong>two symbols</strong> (<strong>High Fantasy</strong>, page <span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>148</strong></span>).

This attack deals no damage, but you apply a copy of the chosen <strong>symbol </strong>to each enemy hit by the attack (each copy counts as a separate <strong>symbol</strong> towards your limit or <strong>【SL + 1】 </strong>active <strong>symbols</strong>).</p><h2><strong>SYMBOLS</strong></h2><ul><li><p>For <strong>symbol</strong> breakdown and a list of Symbols, refer to: @UUID[Compendium.projectfu.handouts.JournalEntry.t38IeNrS9T7NQspT]{Symbol Rules}</p></li></ul>",
