    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Abomination, Experiment, Lycanthrope</strong></h5><p>Some say no progress can be achieved without sacrifice; conveniently enough, these sacrifices are rarely made by those in power. <strong>Mutants</strong> are living testaments to this ruthless arrogance: people whose souls and bodies bear the signs of technological or magical pollution. Each Mutant is a unique being capable of altering their body in strange and unprecedented ways, but their powers come at a painful price and can be a dreadful sight to behold.</p><hr /><h5><strong>MUTANT FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li></ul><h2><strong>MUTANT SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.7ZIT4N07zc2yWsre]{Akromorphosis} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>Your <strong>unarmed strikes</strong> deal <strong>【6 + (SL × 2)】</strong> extra damage, and you gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to your Accuracy Checks with them.</p><p>At the start of your turn during a conflict, you may choose a weapon Category other than <strong>brawling</strong>. If you do, your <strong>unarmed strikes</strong> now belong to the chosen Category; if you choose <strong>bow</strong>, <strong>firearm</strong>, or <strong>thrown</strong>, they become <strong>ranged</strong> weapons instead of <strong>melee</strong>; if you choose <strong>dagger</strong> or <strong>sword</strong>, they cannot be used with <strong>Triple Slash</strong> (see <strong>High Fantasy Atlas</strong>, page <strong>161</strong>). These changes last until the start of your next turn.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.kpg23Fs85uniba2A]{Biphagy} <strong>(SL4)</strong></p><p>After one of your attacks or offensive spells ( @ICON[offensive] ) causes one or more enemies to lose Hit Points, if you are in <strong>Crisis</strong>, you may recover <strong>【SL × 5】</strong> Hit Points.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ij6vcA9nnD915bgI]{Ecdysis}</p><p>After you lose Hit Points due to damage, if that damage had a type other than physical, you may spend 10 Hit Points to gain Resistance to that damage type until you use this Skill again. You cannot use this Skill if doing so would reduce you to 0 HP.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.mWqx8pto9gbbwMoG]{Genoclepsis} <strong>(SL2)</strong></p><p>When you deal damage to one or more NPCs, you learn their Species and the GM chooses <strong>【SL】therioforms</strong> appropriate to those NPCs (see <strong>Techno Fantasy Atlas</strong>, page <strong>156</strong>): if you have acquired the <strong>Theriomorphosis</strong> Skill, you may immediately pay its HP cost and use it to manifest those <strong>therioforms</strong> (even if they are not among those you have learned).</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.pmwdU2AGU0JtrWw8]{Theriomorphosis} <strong>(SL6)</strong></p><p>Each time you acquire this Skill, you learn a <strong>therioform </strong>(see <strong>Techno Fantasy Atlas</strong>, page <strong>156</strong>).</p><p>You may use an action and spend <strong>one third of your current Hit Points</strong> (rounded down) to manifest the effects of <strong>up to two therioforms</strong> you have learned. The details of this transformation are explained on the next page.</p><h2><strong>THERIOFORMS</strong></h2><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif\">For </span><strong>therioform</strong> breakdown and a list of <strong>Therioforms</strong>, refer to:<strong> </strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.handouts.JournalEntry.aXZh9r7OxySQ484p]{Therioforms Rules}</p></li></ul>",
