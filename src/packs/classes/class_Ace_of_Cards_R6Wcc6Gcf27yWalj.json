    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Deckmancer, Destiny Duelist, High Roller</strong></h5><p><strong>Aces of Cards</strong> make use of special decks to perceive the constant fluctuations of the stream of souls. Each deck is inextricably connected to its user and reflects their taste and personality: by drawing specific combinations at the right moment, an Ace of Cards manipulates magical energy to produce supernatural effects. In some worlds, Aces of Cards duel against each other using their personal decks, in a quest for glory or in order to obtain precious artifacts.</p><hr /><h5><strong>ACE OF CARDS FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points <strong>or</strong> Mind Points by 5 (your choice).</li></ul><h2><strong>ACE OF CARDS SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.sfIxI8t0XlJMMVFC]{Double or Nothing}</p><p>Before you perform an Accuracy Check, a Magic Check for an offensive spell ( @ICON[offensive] ), or a Check to advance or turn back a Clock, you may declare <strong>double or nothing</strong>.
