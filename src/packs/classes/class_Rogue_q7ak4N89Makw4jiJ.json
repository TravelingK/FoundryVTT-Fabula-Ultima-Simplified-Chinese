    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Bandit, Ninja, Thief</strong></h5><p>Be they criminals, rebels, or spies, <strong>Rogues</strong> are more than willing to play dirty to get what they want. Rogues are generally quick, witty, and elusive: while a few of them are infamous for being mostly concerned with their personal wealth and profit, many see themselves as fighting against injustice, tyranny, or social exclusion. Tragically, it is quite common for Rogues to end up being painted as threats by those same people they fight for.</p><hr /><h5><strong>ROGUE FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.</li></ul><h2><strong>ROGUE SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.c2XRt5pvOab25Tbe]{Cheap Shot} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>When you hit a creature with an attack, if the attack <strong>only</strong> targeted that creature and they are suffering from <strong>one or more status effects</strong>, you may have it deal extra damage equal to <strong>【SL + the number of status effects on the creature】</strong>.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ksgKc90MZSpDTka7]{Dodge} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>As long as you have no <strong>shields</strong> and no <strong>martial armor</strong> equipped, your Defense score is increased by <strong>【SL】</strong>.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.tiu0D74YNxirN6Tr]{High Speed} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>At the start of a conflict, you may spend 10 Mind Points.
