    "description": "<h5>ALSO: Avenger, Black Knight, Death Knight</h5><p><strong>Darkblades </strong>are somber and powerful warriors who hide a sorrowful past. Due to tragic experiences on the battlefield or in personal life, their souls have developed an affinity for pain and shadow energy. An unlikely hero to say the very least, a Darkblade may now sacrifice their lifeforce to unleash mighty attacks and is able to draw resolve, power and even knowledge from the suffering they experience.</p><hr /><h5>DARKBLADE FREE BENEFITS</h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial melee weapons</strong> and <strong>martial armor</strong>.</li></ul><h2>DARKBLADE SKILLS</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.JPVEY9p8zsGidKJq]{Agony} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>After you deal damage to one or more creatures, if you have a <strong>Bond</strong> towards at least one of those creatures, you may recover <strong>【SL × 2】</strong> Hit Points and <strong>【SL × 2】</strong>Mind Points.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.CEP3nER80UBDH7a9]{Dark Blood}</p><p>As long as you are in Crisis, you have Resistance to <strong>dark</strong> damage and <strong>poison</strong> damage.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.e6ids95gOPher40d]{Heart of Darkness}</p><p>Once per scene upon entering <strong>Crisis</strong>, you may choose a specific creature you can see that you don’t have a <strong>Bond</strong> towards.

If you do, gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】 </strong>to your Check.</p><p>Remember, you can study the same aspect of a creature only once.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.W5hE9L8x7AsJI7a1]{Shadow Strike} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>You have learned to channel your vital force into your attacks. You may use an action to perform a <strong>Shadow Strike</strong>: roll your current <strong>Might</strong> die and lose an amount of Hit Points equal to <strong>【the number rolled on your Might die】</strong>. If this didn’t reduce your Hit Points to 0, you may perform a <strong>free attack</strong> with a weapon you have equipped: if this attack hits one or more targets, it deals extra damage equal to <strong>【SL + the number rolled on your Might die】</strong>. However, all damage dealt by this attack becomes <strong>dark</strong> and its damage type cannot be changed.</p>",
